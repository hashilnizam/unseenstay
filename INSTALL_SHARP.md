# Install Sharp for Favicon Processing

## Quick Setup

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd cms-app
npm install
```

This will install Sharp (v0.33.0) which is now included in `package.json`.

## Manual Installation (if needed)

If the above doesn't work, install Sharp manually:

```bash
cd cms-app
npm install sharp
```

## Restart Server

After installing, restart your CMS server:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start again:
npm run dev
# OR
npm start
```

## Verify Installation

1. Go to CMS ‚Üí Content Editor ‚Üí SEO & Site Configuration
2. Try uploading a favicon
3. You should see: "Favicon processed successfully!"
4. If you see a warning about Sharp, the installation didn't work

## Without Sharp

The favicon upload **will still work** without Sharp, but:
- ‚ùå No automatic resizing
- ‚ùå Original image uploaded as-is
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You'll get a warning message
- üìù You'll need to manually resize images to 32x32px before upload

- **Node.js:** 14.15.0 or higher ‚úÖ
- **Windows:** Works out of the box ‚úÖ
- **Linux:** May need build tools
